# Example PHIP2 Stage 2 submission

This contains preparation and submission files for a PHIP2 stage 2 docking submission (this one utilizing the OpenEye toolkits). This may serve as a reference submission as well.

Here, I used the 5enh.pdb structure, aligned it to PHIPA_C_Apo.pdb with PyMol, saved, then manually extracted the protein and the ligand separately, then fed these into the OEDocking.ipynb notebook to generate predicted poses (using 5enh; initial efforts had trouble getting the PHIPA_C2_Apo structure to work with OEDocking). This is meant just to provide a temporary example.

## Manifest

- `generate_results`: Directory containing tools for generating pose predictions
- `poses`: Directory containing results to be submitted
- `PHIP2_2_OE_reference_description.txt`: Description file, based on the template, describing what was done here. Would be uploaded with the .tar.gz of `poses` to the submission system.
- `5enh.pdb`: 5ENH PDB structure; has ligand in same site as S1
- `5enh-DU_0.oedu`: OpenEye design unit generated by running https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/_downloads/make_design_units.py on 5enh
