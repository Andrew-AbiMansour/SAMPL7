#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following eight elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "PHIP2" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.


# PREDICTIONS SECTION
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Fragment identifier, binding in S1 (true/false), binds in S2 (true/false), binds in S3 (true/false), binds in S4 (true/false), binds in any site (true/false).
# Any compounds not listed are assumed to be predicted as nonbinders.
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

# METHOD NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide a brief (40 character limit) informal yet informative name of the method used.
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# The "Name:" keyword is required, as shown here.
# 40 character limit.
Name:
Deep Learning; k-deep; docking


# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# All major software packages used and their versions.
# Please use a new line for each software.
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# The "Software:" keyword is required.
Software:
Python
RDKIT


# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which of the method category labels describe your prediction the best: `Docking`, `Ligand-based`, `MD`, `ML`, `Other`, `Null`.
# If your method takes advantage of multiple approaches please report more than one category label, separated by comma.
# `Docking` category refers to structure-based virtual screening methods that model the structure of the receptor binding pocket and pose of the ligand followed by an scoring the goodness of the fit .
# `Ligand-based` methods are virtual screening methods that do not rely on protein structure such as pharmacophore modeling, ligand shape-based, 2D or 3D structural similarity based methods.
# `MD` methods utilize molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics including free energy calculations.
# `ML` category includes machine learning, QSPR approaches, and all prediction methods trained on empirical knowledge.
# `Null` predictions employ a model which is not expected to produce useful predictions, however,  can provide a simple comparison point for more sophisticated methods, as ideally, good methods should outperform the null model.
# If these categories do not match your method, report as “Other”.
# If you choose the `Other` category, please explain your decision in the beginning of Method Description section.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Docking, ML


# RANKING INFORMATION SECTION
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
