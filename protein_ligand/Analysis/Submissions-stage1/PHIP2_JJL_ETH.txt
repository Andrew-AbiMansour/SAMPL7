Method:

To predict binding to PHIP2 we trained a random forest classifier. We only attempted to predict binders for the S1 pocket.
Other pockets (S2, S3, S4) are on the outside surface of the protein and are affected by crystal packing. When we generated
crystal lattice for the provided template PDB structure we could see that pockets S2, S3 and S4 were formed at the interface
of neighboring macromolecules.

DATA COLLECTION

We sourced the data from 3 sources: PDB, ChEMBL and publication featuring X-ray structures for PHIP2 (Cox, Oakley B., et al.
"A poised fragment library enables rapid synthetic expansion yielding the first reported inhibitors of PHIP (2), an atypical bromodomain."
Chemical science 7.3 (2016): 2322-2330.)

DATASETS FROM PUBLICATIONS

First part of the data was sourced from a publication on X-ray fragment screening on PHIP2 (Cox, Oakley B., et al. "A poised fragment
library enables rapid synthetic expansion yielding the first reported inhibitors of PHIP (2), an atypical bromodomain." Chemical
science 7.3 (2016): 2322-2330.). The sdf file with DSPL1 library containing 407 fragments was downloaded from the supplementary
information of the publication. 4 fragments were X-ray binders and the remaining 403 were non-binders. This data set was later expanded
with additional follow-up molecules sourced from the same publication, resulting in 6 additional binders and 45 non-binders.

PDB

Due to the lack of available structural data for PHIP2, we extended data collection to other representatives of bromodomain family
that possessed x-ray structure in PDB. The selection was made based on Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org/family/Bromodomain)

1214 PDB structures corresponding to listed Uniprot entries were downloaded and all non-protein residues were extracted from the PDB
structures. For further analyses we excluded modified amino-acids, metal ions and molecules with less than 3 heavy atoms. All associated
SDF files meeting these requirements were retrieved.

ChEMBL

For the same Uniprot codes all available activity data in ChEMBL was collected.

DATA PROCESSING

The molecules provided in SAMPL were prepared using MOE. Protomers and tautomers were enumerated at pH = 6. Stereoisomers were
enumerated if chirality of molecule was not indicated in SMILES. In the end we made a prediction for each of the isomers.

TRAINING SET

Molecules sourced from the publication and PDB molecules were protonated at pH = 6 (as indicated in publication) using MOE. Tautomers and
protomers were enumerated. For the ligands from the publication stereoisomers were enumerated if chirality of molecule was not indicated
in its SMILES. Tautomers and protomers of ChEMBL ligands were enumerated at the pH = 7 using MOE. Due to the size of this data set
(>70k mols) chirality was not considered.

Molecules from both training and test set were represented as a combination of Morgan & Avalon fingerprints (both with nBits=4096)
and all available 2d rdkit descriptors.

MODEL TRAINING

Molecules form the publication were classified as binders based on the information from the paper. All the PDB ligands were
classified as such. All ChEMBL ligands with pAcc > 5.5 were also considered, where pAcc is a negative base 10 logarithm
of an activity measurement (IC50, EC50, Ki, Kd, etc.). All the remaining ChEMBL ligands were considered nonbinders.

As a classifier we used the RandomForestClassifier class as available in the scikit-learn python package, with
n_estimators = 10000, and other hyperparameters set to their default.

PREDICTION

We compute predictions for the augmented test set, selecting those with an associated probabiligy higher than 0.5. Predictions were made
individually for all isomers: a molecule considered active if the maximum predicted probability for any of the isomers was beyond
our defined threshold.
