# The SAMPL7 Blind Prediction Challenges for Computational Chemistry
Challenge details, inputs, and (eventually) results for the SAMPL7 series of challenges

See the [SAMPL website](https://samplchallenges.github.io) for information on the Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) series of challenges as a whole. This repository focuses specifically on the SAMPL7 series of challenges.

Because these files are available publicly, we have no record of who downloads them. Therefore, you should sign up for notifications. Specifically, if you want to receive updates if we uncover any problems, it is imperative that you either (a) sign up for the SAMPL e-mail list via the D3R site, or (b) sign up for notifications of changes to this GitHub repository (the Watch button, above); ideally you would do both. 
Join our [SAMPL7 e-mail list](http://eepurl.com/gpBBun) to get e-mails with SAMPL7-related announcements.
