# Hosts and guests
Provided are the hosts and guests for this challenge in PDB, MOL2 and SDF format.
- Hosts: OA.pdb and exoOA.pdb provided by Paolo Suating (Tulane) April 26, 2019; SAMPL7_hosts.cdx provided by Bruce Gibb April 26, 2019.
- Guests: SAMPL7_guests.cdx provided by Bruce Gibb April 26, 2019.
- `GDCC_hosts_guests_smiles.txt`: SMILES strings for the guest molecules. SMILES strings for the guests were generated by Danielle Bergazin on 6/21/19 by opening up `SAMPL7_guests.cdx` in ChemDraw and converting each structure to a SMILES.
- The PDB, MOL2 and SDF files for each guest was generated using the `input_maker.ipynb` notebook, which uses OpenEye toolkits and the SMILES strings found in `GDCC_hosts_guests_smiles.txt`. The MOL2 and SDF files for the OA and exo-OA hosts were generated in the same notebook, but using the `exoOA.pdb` and `OA.pdb` files as input. Done on 6/21/19 by Danielle Bergazin.
