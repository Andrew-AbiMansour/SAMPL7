# Guests for the SAMPL7 GDCC Challenge

Provided are the guests for this challenge in PDB, MOL2 and SDF format. The guests are codenamed from `g1` to `g8`.

## What's here
- `SAMPL7_guests.cdx` : ChemDraw file of the eight guests provided by Bruce Gibb April 26, 2019.
- `GDCC_hosts_guests_smiles.txt`: isomeric SMILES strings and ids for the guest molecules. SMILES strings for the guests were generated by Danielle Bergazin on 6/21/19 by opening up `SAMPL7_guests.cdx` in ChemDraw and converting each structure to a SMILES string. Codenames for each guest are included in the textfile.
- `input_maker.ipynb`: The jupyter notebook used to generate the PDB, MOL2 and SDF files for each guest using OpenEye toolkits and the SMILES strings and codenames found in `GDCC_hosts_guests_smiles.txt`.
