# The SAMPL7 GDCC Challenge

For SAMPL7, the Gibb group is **tentatively** contributing binding data for eight
guests to two of the Gibb Deep Cavity Cavitand (GDCC) hosts it has frequently studied ---
the familiar "Octa Acid" (OA) host and a newer, *exo*-OA host as detailed below.

## Challenge timing details (preliminary)

The SAMPL7 GDCC challenge is now finalized (as of May 25, 2019) with the details as given below. Additional files will be added to this repository in the near future, but predictions can begin immediately.
Data collection is expected to be completed within three months, which means the
challenge will likely close (with experimental data released) by the end of summer or early fall 2019.

## Proposed challenge for SAMPL7: A Coulombic Challenge

The two hosts shown below, OA (left) and *exo*-OA (right) differ only in the placement of the four water-solubilizing groups.
In the former they are remote from the non-polar pocket, whilst in the latter they are appended directly at the rim of the pocket.

The Gibb group will examine the binding of eight guests: four negatively charged, and four positively charged.
As previously, all binding constants will be determined in sodium phosphate buffer at pH 11.5.
The guests have been selected to partially overlap with previous determinations for binding to OA (first row of guests; known ITC values to be added to this repository later).
These six examples will act as a reference point for the other determinations.
There will be two new determinations for binding to OA (second row of guests), as well as the eight new determinations using new host exo-OA.
Each of the ten new determinations will be carried out in triplicate using ITC, and where necessary, verified by NMR.

Given the identity of these guests, it is likely we will be able to have *some* overlap between the GDCC guests and those used in the modified cyclodextrin (Gilson lab) and acyclic CB (Isaacs lab) portions of the challenge.

### Additional technical details

Tentatively, buffer conditions will be 10 mM sodium phosphate, but this will be confirmed as data collection begins. The plan is to gather data in triplicate with fresh solutions of host and guest on each occasion.  Also, all hosts samples are probed by one of either two ways to determine the waters of hydration in each sample.  This can be as high so this analysis is a requirement to avoid bad data.

For positively charged guests, chloride salts are expected to be used.
