### What's here

- `GDCC_and_guests`: Files for the Gibb Deep Cavity Cavitand (GDCC) challenge, with two hosts sharing a set of guests
- `Isaacs_clip`: Files for the TrimerTrip challenge, on a clip shaped host from Lyle Isaacs which binds a series of guests
- `cyclodextrin_derivative`: Files for the Gilson lab's cyclodextrin derivative challenge, on a series of *hosts* binding two different guests.
- `scripts`: Scripts used in preparing some of the files present here and doing other processing.

Note that we have typically selected reasonable protonation states and conformers of the hosts and guests, but these may be controversial, uncertain, or change upon binding, so participants are encouraged to exercise care in selecting which states are modeled.
