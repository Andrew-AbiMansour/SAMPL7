#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CD challenge, beta CD (bCD) is optional and will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
# Likewise, for the GDCC challenge, OA binding values for guests 1-6 (but not 7-8)
# are optional as literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:

Host, Guest, and Complex Preparation
1) Host and Guest files were charged (AM1-BCC) and a reasonable protonation state (@ pH 6.8) for ionizable groups was assigned using Openeye toolkits
2) Host and guest were docked using AutoDock/Vina, and the top scored guest was selected for minimization and simulations. 
Either 3a or 3b was used to prepare simulation files to use for YANK. When dealing with opposing charge systems that do not neutralize, 
it was necessary to manually prepare the simulation files (3b). Otherwise, using mol2 input files YANK set up our system using the same AMBER programs.
3a) Host and guest mol2 files were made and inspected using PyMol and Chimera.  
3b) Host, guest, and complex were made and parameterized with tleap from AmberTools, and solvated with ~2000 TIP3P waters in a cubic box approximately
41 x 41 x 41 cubic Angstroms. Sodium and Chloride counterions were used to neutralize the system, and additional ions were added to acheive a 
concentration of 25mM. 

Simulations
All simulations were performed with YANK using its OpenMM dependency package as its simulation engine with CUDA platform
4) Explicit absolute free energy simulations were performed in NPT with temperature control using Langivin thermostat at 300.15 K and pressure control by Monte Carlo barostat at 1 atm. 
Long and short range nonbonded interactions were set at a 11 Angstrom cutoff, a solvent clearance of 12 Angstroms, ewald error tolerance of 0.0001, 
and switch distance of 10 Angstroms using the PME method. Harmonic restraints were applied to all systems. 

5) An initial minimization with YANK was conducted for 500 ps. All simulations included sampling windows with a minimum of 16 ns, and were extended as 
needed to bring the free energy prediction standard error below 0.5 kcal/mol (this was not achieved for all simulations). The longest simulation per window was 30ns. 

Two protocols were used: (A) For systems with neutral guests (only for CD/derivatives with guest 1) the protocol had 29 lambda windows. However, systems with charged guests
had replica swaps and mixing which were not ideal. In these cases, the next protocol was used. 
(B) For systems with charged guests the protocol had 61 lambda windows, where the lambda values were identified using YANKs auto pipeline.
This protocol was also used for GDCC and Clip systems. 

NOTE- For CD/derivative hosts with guest 1 (g1) simulations had uncertainties below 0.5 kcal/mol and converged quickly. To save time and resources these
simulations were not extended past 16 ns.
