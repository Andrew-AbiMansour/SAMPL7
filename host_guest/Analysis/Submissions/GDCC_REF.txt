# Results for GDCC
#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "GDCC" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CD challenge, beta CD (bCD) is optional and will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
# Likewise, for the GDCC challenge, OA binding values for guests 1-6 (but not 7-8)
# are optional as literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
Host, Guest, and Complex Preparation
1) Host and Guest files were charged (AM1-BCC) and a reasonable protonation state (@ pH 11.7) for ionizable groups was assigned using Openeye toolkits
2) Host and guest were docked using AutoDock/Vina, and the top scored guest was selected for minimization and simulations. 
3) Host, guest, and complex were made and parameterized with tleap from AmberTools, and solvated with ~2000 TIP3P waters in a cubic box approximately
41 x 41 x 41 cubic Angstroms. Sodium and Chloride counterions were used to neutralize the system, and additional ions were added to acheive a 
concentration of 10mM.  

Simulations
All simulations were performed with YANK using its OpenMM dependency package as its simulation engine with CUDA platform
4) Explicit absolute free energy simulations were performed in NPT with temperature control using Langivin thermostat at 298 K and pressure control by Monte Carlo barostat at 1 atm. 
Long and short range nonbonded interactions were set at a 11 Angstrom cutoff, a solvent clearance of 12 Angstroms, ewald error tolerance of 0.0001, 
and switch distance of 10 Angstroms using the PME method. Harmonic restraints were applied to all systems. 

5) An initial minimization with YANK was conducted for 500 ps. All simulations included sampling windows of 26 ns to bring the free energy prediction standard error 
below 0.5 kcal/mol (this was not achieved for all simulations).     
 
We used 61 lambda windows, where the lambda values were identified using YANKs auto pipeline.
