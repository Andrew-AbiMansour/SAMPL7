# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "Clip" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)

#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CD challenge, beta CD (bCD) is optional and will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
# Likewise, for the GDCC challenge, OA binding values for guests 1-6 (but not 7-8)
# are optional as literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:

Host, Guest, and Complex Preparation
1) Host and Guest files were charged (AM1-BCC) and a reasonable protonation state (@ pH 7.4) for ionizable groups was assigned using Openeye toolkits
2) Host and guest were docked using AutoDock/Vina, and the top scored guest was selected for minimization and simulations. 
3) Host, guest, and complex were made and parameterized with tleap from AmberTools, and solvated with ~2000 TIP3P waters in a cubic box approximately
41 x 41 x 41 cubic Angstroms. Sodium and Chloride counterions were used to neutralize the system, and additional ions were added to acheive a 
concentration of 20mM. 

Simulations 
All simulations were performed with YANK using its OpenMM dependency package as its simulation engine with CUDA platform
4) Explicit absolute free energy simulations were performed in NPT with temperature control using Langivin thermostat at 298 K and pressure control by Monte Carlo barostat at 1 atm. 
Long and short range nonbonded interactions were set at a 11 Angstrom cutoff, a solvent clearance of 12 Angstroms, ewald error tolerance of 0.0001, 
and switch distance of 10 Angstroms using the PME method. Harmonic restraints were applied to all systems. 

5) An initial minimization with YANK was conducted for 500 ps. All simulations included sampling windows of 30 ns to bring the free energy prediction standard error 
below 0.5 kcal/mol (this was not achieved for all simulations). Exception was clip-g1, was stopped at 26ns.    
 
We used 61 lambda windows, where the lambda values were identified using YANKs auto pipeline. 

NOTE- Most linear / aliphatic guests g1-g5, g12, g16 had starting poses at the center (opening) of trimer trip. The exceptions were g15 and g17, which along with all cyclic and aromitic guests
bount at what we termed "surface" or near trimertrips "flap". All guests which did not start at the "center" eventually travel and interact in the opening of trimer trip. 
A separate experiments was run on clip-g11, where we extracted an open conformer of trimertrip, redocked g11, and ran the simulation. 
We expect other guests with similar starting poses to require an "open" conformer to provide a more efficient simulation, and likely improve predictions and uncertainties.
